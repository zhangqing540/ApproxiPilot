The Design Space Exploration (DSE) component serves as the optimization engine of the ApproxiPilot framework, responsible for multi-objective optimization and automated exploration of approximate computing design configurations. This component takes performance predictions from trained GNN models and systematically explores the design space to identify Pareto-optimal solutions across multiple hardware metrics including area, power, latency, and SSIM quality measures.
